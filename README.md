# MyReads Project

My Reads app is one of the assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.
A user can select and categorize books into 3 different shelves - Read, currently reading and want to read.

It's built using React and React Router.

## Backend Server

We will be using a backend server provided by Udacity and details of API is provided in the file - [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js)
This file contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

- [`getAll`](#getall)
- [`update`](#update)
- [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll();
```

- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
- This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf);
```

- book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
- shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]
- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query, maxResults);
```

- query: `<String>`
- maxResults: `<Integer>` Due to the nature of the backend server, search results are capped at 20, even if this is set higher.
- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
- These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
